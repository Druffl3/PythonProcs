The tale goes such that, you don't wanna know.
If we run this command, it will store the first line in the variable "file_stuff" then print the first line.
We can use the method "readline" twice. The first time it's called, it will save the first line in the variable "file_stuff," and then print the first line. The second time it's called, it will save the second line in the variable "file_stuff," and then print the second line. We can use a loop to print out each line individually as follows. Let's represent every character in a string as a grid. We can specify the number of characters we would like to read from the string as an argument to the method "readlines." When we use a four as an argument in the method "readlines," we print out the first four characters in the file. Each time we call the method, we will progress through the text. If we call a method with the arguments 16, the first 16 characters are printed out, and then the new line. If we call the method a second time, the next five characters are printed out.
